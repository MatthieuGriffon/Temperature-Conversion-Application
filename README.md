# Temperature Conversion Application

This application, my first project with Expo and React Native, enables users to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit units. Thanks to an intuitive user interface, the app displays a dynamic background that changes based on the entered temperature: a warm background for high temperatures and a cold background for low temperatures.

## Main Features

- **Temperature Conversion:** Converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit by entering a value and pressing a button to change the unit.
- **Dynamic Display:** The screen background automatically switches between a warm image and a cold image, depending on the entered temperature.
- **Intuitive User Interface:** Provides easy temperature input and clear visualization of the conversion.

## Technologies Used

- **Expo:** A framework and platform for universal iOS, Android, and web applications, based on React Native.
- **React Native:** Allows building a native mobile application using JavaScript and React.

## Getting Started

To install and start the application, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone your-repo-url
cd your-project-name
npm install
expo start
```
Make sure you have Expo CLI installed on your computer. If not, you can install it via npm:
```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```
## Usage
- After starting the application with Expo, scan the QR code with the Expo app on your phone (available on the App Store or Google Play) to see the application in action on your device.
